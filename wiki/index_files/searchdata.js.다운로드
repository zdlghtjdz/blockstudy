David Chaum은 1983년 은닉서명(Blind Signiture) 라는 기술을 개발하였습니다.“추적이 불가능한 결제를 위한 은닉 서명”으로 거래 당사자의 신분을 노출시키지 않고 결제 사실을 검증하는 기술을 제안하였으며, 각 메시지의 내용을 블라인드처리, 그 결과로 생성 된 서명은 일반 디지털 서명과 같은 원래의 맹목적이지 않은 메시지에 대해 공개적으로 검증 될 수 있습니다.이렇듯 제안한 디지털 서명 기술과 암호학 관련 개념들은 암호화폐의 근간을 이루는 기술로 발전되었다고 언급됩니다.1989년 자신의 아이디어 기반으로 만든 디지털화폐 회사인 DigiCash를 설립하였으며 암호화, 개인키 및 공개키, 블라인드 서명 기술을 적용하여 디지털화된 달러에 고유한 Hash 값을 붙여 만들어진 세계 최초의 암호화폐인 ‘ECash’를 출시하게 됩니다.1994년 DigiCash는 ECash를 사용한 첫 전자 결제에 성공하고 1995년 미국의 소규모 은행과 파트너십을 맺어 디지털 화폐를 운영하기 시작했습니다.하지만, 프라이버시 보호 보다는 더 편리하고, 보편화된 신용카드를 선호하는 소비자들에게 외면당해 파산하게 되었습니다.      Skip      Awesome! Great job.  Similarly, to make phrases bold in Markdown, you can surround    words with two asterisks ( ** ). This will **really**    get your point across.  In the box below, make the word will bold.            Skip      Good work!  Of course, you can use _both italics and bold_ in the same line.    You can also span them **across multiple words**.  In the box below, make the words Of course italic, and the words a little moxie bold.            Skip          Fantastic!    For the final exercise in this lesson, we're going to make some words bold    and italic.    In general, it doesn't matter which order you place the asterisks or underscores.      In the box below, make the words This is unbelievable both bold and italic.      Place the asterisks **_on the outside_**, just to make it more legible.            Skip    Now you know how to make things bold and italic in Markdown!  On to the next lesson!"

Demogroups create demos to demonstrate their abilities in programming, music, drawing, and 3D modeling. The key difference between a classical animation and a demo is that the display of a demo is computed in real time, making computing power considerations the biggest challenge. Demos are mostly composed of 3D animations mixed with 2D effects and full screen effects.The boot block demos of the 1980s, demos that were created to fit within the small (generally 512 to 4096 bytes) first block of the floppy disk that was to be loaded into RAM,[1] were typically created so that software crackers could boast of their accomplishment prior to the loading of the game. What began as a type of electronic graffiti on cracked software became an art form unto itself. The demoscene both produced and inspired many techniques used by video games and 3D rendering applications today - for instance, light bloom, among others.![Demo Pic](/blockstudy/wiki/Beyond_-_Conspiracy_-_2004_-_64k_intro.jpg)"

It allows you to dynamically include a custom html code using the jekyll partials.**NOTE**: Your file must be added inside the _include folder### Style changes (head)If you need a simple style change the easiest way to do it is including a custom css file that is able to add/overwrite default css rules.  To do it you can add in your _config.yml the following configuration:```inc_after_styles : path/to/your/style.html ```  then in your _include folder you must add file defined above. It must be an html withthe  elements inside.  For example:   **NOTE**: as you can see we're using relative_url jekyll function allowing us to include the css file of our assets folder.  ### Add your components  With the same method used to include styles file you are able to use our including hooks to add your code everywhere you want.You can find the list of all hooks at the bottom of this page#### Sidebar  If you need to add content inside sidebar of our default layout you can use following hook:`inc_after_header: my_sidebar_file.html`#### Comments  If you need to add a comment component (for example disqus) you can use following hook:  `inc_after_content: my_comments_file.html`## Layout refactoringBefore working with layout refactoring you should learn:* how to work with Jekyll: [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)* which are the components of git-wiki, you can find them here: https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki/tree/master/_includes* Take a look at git-wiki default layouts to understand how to build your: https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki/tree/master/_layoutsIf you need to totally change the layout of your wiki you can create a custom file in _layout folder and reuse only components that you need in the place that you want.  You've just to change following config:```defaults: -    scope:      path:  # an empty string here means all files in the project    values:      layout: git-wiki-default -    scope:      path:       type: pages    values:      layout: git-wiki-default```  replacing **layout: git-wiki-default** with name of your custom layout.## Configuration keys:  Read _config.yml.dist file of your git-wiki installation for detailed list of configuration values (commented)"
